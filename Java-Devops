🔹 1. Basics (Every DevOps Engineer Should Know)

What is Java?

High-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language.

“Write Once, Run Anywhere” → JVM executes bytecode on any OS.

Core Java Concepts

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) → executes bytecode.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) → JVM + libraries for running apps.

JDK (Java Development Kit) → JRE + compiler (javac) for development.

Bytecode → compiled .class files understood by JVM.

OOP Principles (important for microservices design)

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

Basic Commands

javac HelloWorld.java    # compile
java HelloWorld          # run
java -version            # check version


✅ Must-know to understand how Java apps run in containers/Kubernetes.

🔹 2. Medium-Level Concepts (Practical DevOps Usage)

Build Tools

Maven → uses pom.xml, dependency + build management.

Gradle → faster, uses Groovy/Kotlin DSL.

Ant (legacy).

Packaging & Deployment

.jar (Java Archive) → libraries or standalone apps.

.war (Web Archive) → deploy on servlet container (Tomcat, JBoss).

.ear (Enterprise Archive) → legacy enterprise apps.

Spring Boot (Most Common in DevOps)

Embedded Tomcat → no need for external server.

REST APIs → microservices architecture.

Profiles (dev, test, prod).

Externalized configs (application.yml, Config Server, Consul, Vault).

Logging

Log4j, Logback, SLF4J.

Logs → shipped to ELK/EFK stack.

Testing

JUnit, Mockito.

Important for CI/CD pipelines.

Environment Variables

Pass configs/secrets into apps via -Dproperty=value or env vars.

✅ This is where DevOps interacts daily with Java apps.

🔹 3. Advanced Concepts (FAANG-Level)

JVM Internals

Class Loader → loads classes.

JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time) → optimizes bytecode at runtime.

Garbage Collector (GC) → frees unused memory. Types:

Serial GC

Parallel GC

G1 GC (common in production).

JVM Tuning

Heap size: -Xmx512m -Xms256m.

GC tuning for performance.

Thread dumps, heap dumps (troubleshooting).

Monitoring & Profiling

JConsole, JVisualVM → monitor heap, threads.

Prometheus JMX Exporter → expose JVM metrics.

Grafana Dashboards → visualize JVM performance.

Java in Containers

Slim JDK/JRE base images (AdoptOpenJDK, Eclipse Temurin).

Multi-stage Docker builds → reduce image size.

Use jlink to create minimal runtime images.

Security

Avoid hardcoding secrets (use Vault, Kubernetes secrets).

HTTPS/TLS config for Spring Boot apps.

JVM Security Manager (deprecated in Java 17+).

✅ These topics are favorite FAANG interview questions for DevOps engineers.

🔹 4. Real-World DevOps Scenarios

Microservices Deployment → Spring Boot apps in Docker → Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS).

Config Management → externalize configs with Spring Config Server + Git or HashiCorp Vault.

Observability → Micrometer + Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.

CI/CD Pipelines → build with Maven/Gradle → unit tests → SonarQube → push Docker image → deploy to K8s.

Log Aggregation → logback → Fluentd/Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana.

Scaling → Java app scaled with HPA in Kubernetes.

Performance Issues → high GC pauses → fix via G1 GC + tuning.

Zero-Downtime Deployment → rolling updates in Kubernetes with readiness probes.

✅ Shows you can run Java apps in production at scale.

🔹 5. Common Interview Questions (DevOps-Focused)

Explain JDK, JRE, and JVM.

What is bytecode?

What is the difference between .jar and .war?

What is Garbage Collection? Types of GCs?

How do you monitor JVM performance in production?

How do you pass configs/secrets to a Java app?

How do you containerize a Java app?

How do you optimize JVM memory usage inside Kubernetes?

Maven vs Gradle? Which one is better for CI/CD?

How do you externalize configs in Spring Boot?

How do you handle logging in Java apps running on K8s?

How do you tune Java apps for high performance?

How do you debug a memory leak in production?

Explain thread dump vs heap dump.

What’s your experience running Java microservices in Kubernetes?

🔹 6. Example Pitch (Interview-Ready)

“In my Gamazon project, most microservices were written in Spring Boot. We used Maven for builds, packaged as Docker images, and deployed on EKS. Configurations were externalized via Spring Config Server + AWS Secrets Manager. Logging was handled with Logback → Fluentd → Elasticsearch → Kibana. We monitored JVM metrics (GC, heap, thread count) via Prometheus JMX Exporter and visualized in Grafana. We tuned heap size and switched to G1 GC for better performance. For CI/CD, Jenkins pipelines automated Maven builds, SonarQube analysis, Docker builds, and Kubernetes deployments.”

🐧 Linux Complete Topics for DevOps Interviews

🔹 1. Basics
- Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Debian)
- File system hierarchy (/bin, /etc, /var, /home, /tmp, /usr)
- File/Directory operations → ls, pwd, cd, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir, touch
- File viewing → cat, head, tail, less, more, nano, vim
- User commands → whoami, id, who, adduser, passwd

🔹 2. Medium (Day-to-Day DevOps work)
- File permissions → chmod, chown, groups, umask
- Process management → ps aux, top, kill, jobs, fg, bg
- Searching & filtering → grep, find, awk, sed
- Disk monitoring → df -h, du -sh, lsblk, mount
- Networking basics → ping, curl, wget, netstat, ss, ifconfig, ip addr
- Logs monitoring → /var/log/, tail -f, journalctl
- Environment variables → echo $PATH, export VAR=value, .bashrc
- File redirection & pipes → >, >>, 2>, |, tee

🔹 3. Advanced (Real-time Admin Level)
- Shell scripting → loops, conditions, variables, functions
- Package management → yum, apt, rpm, dpkg
- Cron jobs → crontab -e, /etc/cron.d
- Services management → systemctl start/stop/enable/status
- Monitoring performance → uptime, free -m, vmstat, iostat, sar
- SSH, SCP, Rsync → secure login, copy, sync files
- Archiving/Compression → tar, gzip, zip, unzip
- SELinux / AppArmor basics
- Hostname & DNS configs → /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf
- Kernel & system info → uname -r, /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo

🔹 4. Interview-Oriented Scenarios
- Disk full issue → find & clean large files (du, df)
- Port conflict → check with lsof, netstat, ss
- Website down troubleshooting → ping, curl, logs
- High CPU/memory usage → top, ps aux --sort=-%mem
- Hard link vs Soft link → difference
- Script to monitor a log file and send alert
- Script to find top 5 CPU-consuming processes

🚨 What’s Missing? (Minor but Useful for Tough Interviews)
⚠️ These are rarely asked, but advanced companies sometimes test:
- LVM (Logical Volume Management) basics → pvcreate, vgcreate, lvcreate
- Inodes concept (disk structure, df -i)
- Linux boot process (BIOS → Bootloader → Kernel → Init → systemd)
- Firewall basics → firewalld, iptables, ufw
- Swap space check → swapon -s, free -m
- File descriptors (ulimit -n)
- Signals (kill -l)

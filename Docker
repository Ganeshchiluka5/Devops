🔹 1. Basics (Every DevOps Engineer Must Know)

What is Docker?

Open-source containerization platform.

Packages apps + dependencies into lightweight containers.

Ensures consistency across dev → test → prod.

Core Concepts

Image → blueprint for container (read-only layers).

Container → running instance of image.

Dockerfile → instructions to build image.

Docker Hub → public registry for images.

Volumes → persistent storage for containers.

Network → communication between containers.

Basic Commands

docker --version                  # check version
docker pull nginx                 # pull image
docker images                     # list images
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx    # run container
docker ps -a                      # list containers
docker stop <id> && docker rm <id> # stop & remove
docker exec -it <id> bash         # enter container
docker logs <id>                  # view logs


✅ Must-know for daily usage.

🔹 2. Medium-Level Concepts (Practical DevOps Usage)

Dockerfile Basics

FROM → base image.

RUN → execute commands.

COPY / ADD → copy files into image.

WORKDIR → set working dir.

CMD → default execution command.

ENTRYPOINT → main process (overridable).

EXPOSE → ports to be opened.

Image Management

docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
docker tag myapp:1.0 myrepo/myapp:1.0
docker push myrepo/myapp:1.0


Volumes

Named volumes → managed by Docker.

Bind mounts → map host paths.

tmpfs → in-memory storage.

Networking

Bridge → default (containers on same host).

Host → use host’s networking.

Overlay → multi-host networking (Swarm/K8s).

Docker Compose

Multi-container apps defined in docker-compose.yml.

Example:

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root


✅ Prepares you for real team workflows.

🔹 3. Advanced Concepts (FAANG-Level)

Image Optimization

Use multi-stage builds.

Minimize image size with alpine.

Cache layers for faster builds.

Container Lifecycle

Restart Policies → always, unless-stopped, on-failure.

Healthchecks → monitor container status.

Security

Docker Bench for Security.

Use non-root users inside containers.

Sign images with Docker Content Trust (DCT).

Scan images with Trivy/Clair/Anchore.

Docker Registry

Self-hosted → Harbor, Nexus, Artifactory.

Use private registry with authentication.

Networking Advanced

Custom networks with DNS-based service discovery.

Connect containers across multiple hosts (Overlay + K8s).

Docker Swarm (optional)

Native orchestrator (less popular vs K8s).

Concepts → Services, Tasks, Overlay network.

✅ Covers advanced interviews.

🔹 4. Real-World DevOps Scenarios

CI/CD Pipelines → Jenkins builds Docker image → pushes to registry → deploys to Kubernetes.

Microservices → each service containerized → communicate via bridge/overlay networks.

Persistent Data → mount volumes for DBs (MySQL, MongoDB).

Monitoring → cAdvisor + Prometheus + Grafana.

Logging → Fluentd/EFK stack collects logs from containers.

Security → image scanning + non-root containers.

Blue-Green Deployment → switch between container versions.

Disaster Recovery → backup volumes + rebuild containers from images.

✅ Shows real-world production expertise.

🔹 5. Common Interview Questions

Difference between Image and Container?

Docker vs Virtual Machine?

Explain a Dockerfile workflow.

CMD vs ENTRYPOINT?

What are Docker volumes? Why use them?

How do you optimize Docker images?

Explain Docker networking types.

Docker Compose vs Kubernetes?

How do you secure Docker containers?

How do you handle secrets in Docker?

Difference between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?

How do you integrate Docker with Jenkins?

How do you monitor Docker containers?

How do you troubleshoot a failing container?

How do you implement Blue-Green deployment with Docker?

✅ With this, you’ll handle any Docker interview confidently.
💡 Example pitch:
“In Gamazon project, we containerized microservices using Docker. Jenkins pipelines built images, pushed them to AWS ECR, and deployed on Kubernetes. We used multi-stage builds for optimization, Trivy for scanning, and mounted EBS volumes for persistent DB storage. Monitoring was done via cAdvisor + Prometheus + Grafana.”

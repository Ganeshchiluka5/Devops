🔹 1. Basics (Every DevOps Engineer Must Know)

What is Python?

High-level, interpreted, object-oriented language.

Strong in automation, scripting, APIs, DevOps tooling, ML/AI.

Widely used in DevOps for automation, cloud SDKs, monitoring scripts, CI/CD integration.

Core Concepts

Data Types → int, float, string, list, tuple, dict, set.

Control Structures → if-else, loops, try-except.

Functions → def my_function():.

Modules/Packages → import & reuse code.

Virtual Environments → venv, pipenv.

Basic Commands

python3 script.py       # run script
python3 -m venv venv    # create virtual env
pip install requests    # install package
pip freeze > reqs.txt   # export dependencies


✅ Foundation to write and run automation scripts.

🔹 2. Medium-Level Concepts (Practical DevOps Usage)

File Handling

Read/write logs, configs.

OS & Sys Modules

Automate system tasks (file, processes, env vars).

Subprocess Module

Run shell commands inside Python.

import subprocess
subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"])


Requests Module

Call REST APIs (CI/CD, cloud services).

JSON & YAML

Parse config files (Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible).

Logging

Use logging module for structured logs.

Virtual Environments

Isolate dependencies → production safe.

Package Management

pip (default), pipenv, poetry (advanced).

✅ Covers daily automation scripts & tool integration.

🔹 3. Advanced Concepts (FAANG-Level)

OOP in Python

Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.

Decorators

Useful for logging, authentication wrappers.

Generators

Memory-efficient data streaming.

Context Managers

with open("file.txt") as f: → auto resource cleanup.

Error Handling

Custom exceptions, try-except-finally.

Concurrency

Threading → I/O bound tasks.

Multiprocessing → CPU bound tasks.

AsyncIO → async programming (APIs, network).

DevOps Libraries

boto3 → AWS automation.

google-cloud-python → GCP.

azure-mgmt → Azure.

docker-py → Docker automation.

kubernetes-client → manage K8s via Python.

ansible-runner → run Ansible playbooks via Python.

Testing

pytest, unittest.

Mock APIs in CI/CD pipelines.

Packaging

Create your own library → setup.py.

✅ This is where DevOps scripting + tool integration shines.

🔹 4. Real-World DevOps Scenarios

Automation Scripts → restart services, cleanup logs, patch systems.

Cloud Automation → use boto3 to create EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM.

CI/CD → Python scripts for GitHub/Jenkins pipelines.

Kubernetes Ops → auto scale pods, rotate secrets, backup ETCD.

Infrastructure Validation → scripts to check Terraform/Ansible outputs.

Monitoring → custom exporters for Prometheus (write a Python script exposing metrics).

Log Processing → parse & ship logs to ELK.

Security → rotate AWS keys, scan Docker images.

Cost Optimization → auto shutdown idle resources.

✅ Shows real DevOps value in interviews.

🔹 5. Security & Best Practices

Use virtual environments (no global pip installs).

Never hardcode secrets → use env vars / Vault.

Use black / flake8 → code formatting.

Add error handling & retries for API calls.

Version control → store scripts in GitHub.

🔹 6. Common Interview Questions (DevOps-Focused)

Difference between Python 2 & 3?

List vs Tuple vs Dict vs Set?

What is *args and **kwargs?

Explain Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock).

Threading vs Multiprocessing vs AsyncIO?

How do you handle errors in Python?

How do you create a virtual environment?

Explain decorators with example.

How do you parse JSON/YAML in Python?

How do you call REST APIs in Python?

How do you automate AWS with boto3?

How do you interact with Kubernetes from Python?

How do you write a Prometheus exporter in Python?

How do you package and distribute a Python library?

How do you use Python in CI/CD pipelines?

🔹 7. Example Pitch (Interview-Ready)

“In my Gamazon project, I used Python extensively for automation. For AWS, I used boto3 to automate EC2 and S3 provisioning. We also wrote Python scripts to validate Terraform state and trigger Ansible playbooks. For Kubernetes, I used the Python Kubernetes client to automate scaling and secret rotation. In CI/CD, Python scripts integrated with Jenkins pipelines for deployment verification. For monitoring, I developed a custom Prometheus exporter in Python to expose JVM metrics from our apps, which were visualized in Grafana.”

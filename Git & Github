🔹 1. Basics (Core Foundations)

Git → Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
GitHub → Cloud platform for hosting Git repos + collaboration tools.

Core Concepts

Repository (Repo) → project storage (local/remote).

Commit → snapshot of code (unique SHA).

Branch → independent line of development.

HEAD → pointer to current branch/commit.

Staging Area (Index) → files prepared for commit.

Remote → hosted repo (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).

Essential Commands

git init | clone <url>     # create or copy repo
git status                 # view changes
git add .                  # stage changes
git commit -m "message"    # commit
git push origin main       # push to remote
git pull origin main       # fetch + merge remote
git log --oneline          # history
git diff                   # show diffs


✅ Must-know for daily DevOps work.

🔹 2. Medium-Level Concepts (Team Collaboration)

Branching Strategies

Feature Branching → new features in isolation.

Git Flow → main, develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*.

Trunk-Based → small, frequent merges → CI/CD friendly.

Merging Approaches

Merge Commit → preserves full history.

Rebase → linear history, cleaner logs.

Squash Merge → compress multiple commits into one.

Important Commands

git fetch                 # get latest without merge
git merge origin/main     # merge remote branch
git reset --hard <commit> # reset HEAD & working dir
git revert <commit>       # undo commit (safe)
git stash / stash apply   # save & restore temp changes
git tag v1.0.0            # version tag


GitHub Features

Pull Requests (PRs) → review + merge workflow.

Issues & Projects → bug tracking & Kanban.

Actions → built-in CI/CD pipelines.

✅ Enables effective collaboration.

🔹 3. Advanced Concepts (FAANG-Level Depth)

Advanced Operations

Cherry-Pick → apply specific commit to another branch.

Bisect → binary search for bug-causing commit.

Worktrees → checkout multiple branches at once.

History Rewriting

git rebase -i HEAD~n → squash/reorder commits.

git commit --amend → modify last commit.
⚠️ Don’t rewrite shared history.

Hooks

Local automation: pre-commit, pre-push, commit-msg.

Submodules

Manage nested repos → git submodule add <url>.

Large Scale

Git LFS → handle large binaries/media.

Monorepo → multiple projects in one repo.

Security

GPG-signed commits → git commit -S.

Branch protection → prevent force-push.

Dependabot → auto security fixes.

GitHub Enterprise Features

Actions → multi-env CI/CD.

Environments → staging/prod approvals.

Code Owners → enforce reviewers.

GitHub Packages → container/image registry.

✅ These are asked in senior-level interviews.

🔹 4. Real-World DevOps Scenarios

CI/CD Integration → Jenkins/GitHub Actions triggered on PRs.

Branch Protection Rules → mandatory PR reviews + status checks.

Release Management → tags, changelogs, GitHub Releases.

Secrets Management → GitHub Encrypted Secrets for pipelines.

Disaster Recovery → restore with git reflog.

GitOps → ArgoCD/Flux deploy infra from GitHub.

Multi-Team Collaboration → monorepo + PR-based workflows.

Audit & Compliance → signed commits, approval gates.

✅ Shows production-level expertise.

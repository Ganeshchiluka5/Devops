ðŸ”¹ 1. Basics (Every DevOps Engineer Must Know)

IAM

Users, Groups, Roles

IAM Roles for EC2, EKS, CodePipeline

Least privilege principle

MFA for security

EC2

Launch instances â†’ Jenkins, Docker runners

User Data scripts â†’ bootstrap tools

EBS Volumes â†’ snapshots for backup

VPC Basics

Public Subnet â†’ ALB, Bastion hosts

Private Subnet â†’ Apps, DBs

NAT Gateway â†’ private â†’ internet access

Route Tables â†’ traffic routing

Security Groups vs NACLs

S3

Store artifacts, logs, Terraform state

Versioning + Lifecycle policies

Cross-region replication

Route53

DNS â†’ domain management

Weighted routing (blue/green, canary)

Failover routing

ðŸ”¹ 2. CI/CD Related AWS Services

CodeCommit â†’ Git repo (alt: GitHub)

CodeBuild â†’ build/test code (like Jenkins agent)

CodeDeploy â†’ deploy to EC2, Lambda, ECS

CodePipeline â†’ CI/CD orchestrator

ECR â†’ Docker image registry

IAM + KMS â†’ secure pipeline secrets

ðŸ”¹ 3. Infra as Code (IaC)

CloudFormation â†’ AWS native IaC

Terraform (industry standard)

Store remote state in S3

Enable state locking with DynamoDB

Organize modules for reusability

ðŸ”¹ 4. Containers & Orchestration

ECS â†’ AWS container orchestration (less common in interviews)

EKS â†’ Kubernetes on AWS (most companies use this)

Managed Control Plane

Worker nodes â†’ EC2 or Fargate

IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)

Ingress Controller + ALB for traffic

ECR â†’ private container image registry

ðŸ”¹ 5. Monitoring & Logging

CloudWatch

Metrics â†’ CPU, Memory (custom)

Logs â†’ app/system logs

Alarms â†’ triggers scaling/alerts

CloudTrail â†’ who did what in AWS (auditing)

X-Ray â†’ app tracing

EventBridge â†’ event-driven workflows

ðŸ”¹ 6. Networking & Scaling

ELB (ALB/NLB) â†’ traffic distribution

Auto Scaling Groups â†’ handle demand automatically

VPC Peering / Transit Gateway â†’ multi-VPC connectivity

CloudFront â†’ CDN (for static content, caching)

Direct Connect â†’ on-prem to AWS

ðŸ”¹ 7. Security & Secrets Management

Secrets Manager â†’ store DB creds, API keys (auto-rotation)

SSM Parameter Store â†’ configs/parameters

KMS â†’ encrypt S3, EBS, RDS data

SSM Session Manager â†’ access EC2 without SSH

ðŸ”¹ 8. Storage & Databases (DevOps Relevant)

EBS â†’ block storage (snapshots, resize)

EFS â†’ shared NFS storage (useful for Jenkins/EKS logs)

RDS â†’ managed DBs, Multi-AZ, backups

DynamoDB â†’ Terraform state locking, event-driven apps

ðŸ”¹ 9. Advanced (Production/Interview Focus)

Blue-Green Deployments â†’ CodeDeploy + ALB target groups

Canary Deployments â†’ Route53 weighted routing

Serverless CI/CD â†’ Lambda + API Gateway + CodePipeline

Disaster Recovery â†’

S3 cross-region replication

RDS Multi-AZ + Read Replicas

Route53 Failover

Cost Optimization

Spot instances for Jenkins runners

Right-size EKS nodes

S3 lifecycle policies

ðŸ”¹ 10. Common Interview Scenarios (Must-Practice)

CI/CD Pipeline â†’ CodePipeline + CodeBuild + CodeDeploy + ECR + ECS/EKS

App Deployment â†’ Docker â†’ push to ECR â†’ deploy to EKS (IaC with Terraform)

Terraform Remote State â†’ S3 + DynamoDB locking

Kubernetes on AWS â†’ EKS + ALB Ingress + CloudWatch monitoring

Secrets Management â†’ Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store

Auto Scaling â†’ ASG + ALB across Multi-AZ

Monitoring â†’ CloudWatch + Prometheus + Grafana

DR Plan â†’ Multi-region RDS, Route53 failover, S3 replication

Secure Pipelines â†’ IAM roles, KMS encryption, CodeBuild env vars

Blue-Green/Canary â†’ ALB + Route53 weighted routing
